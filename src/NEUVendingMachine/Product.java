 *    - Data and methods that operate on that data are bundled together
 *
 * 2. Information Hiding:
 *    - Internal state is private and can only be modified through methods
 *    - Implementation details are hidden from other classes
 *
 * 3. Abstraction:
 *    - Represents a real-world product with essential attributes
 *    - Provides a simple interface to interact with product data
 *
 * 4. Polymorphism:
 *    - Overrides toString() method from Object class
 *    - Demonstrates runtime polymorphism
